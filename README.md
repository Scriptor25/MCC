## Included Example Project

The [example project](example) contains, like the name suggest, some example source files. This includes
some [math operations](example/src/math.mcc), some simple snippets
like [hello world](example/src/hello.mcc), [ping-pong](example/src/ping.mcc) or [gold](example/src/gold.mcc), that
were used to test several different functionalities, but most of those merged over time into a unified system. The most
complex but still simple example is [sphere](example/src/sphere.mcc), which generates a sphere for a given radius and
position in the world.

![three differently sized spheres floating over a flat world](docs/spheres.png)

The example shown in the screenshot are three spheres, one with radius 40 (the biggest one), 20 and 5. The one with 5
executed instantly, while the one with 20 took about 4 seconds and the 40 block radius took whole 40 seconds to appear.
