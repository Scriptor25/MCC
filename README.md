## Included Example Project

The [example project](example) contains, like the name suggest, some example source files. This includes
some [math operations](example/src/math.mcc), some simple snippets
like [hello world](example/src/hello.mcc), [ping-pong](example/src/ping.mcc) or [gold](example/src/gold.mcc), that
were used to test several different functionalities, but most of those merged over time into a unified system. The most
complex but still simple example is [sphere](example/src/sphere.mcc), which generates a sphere for a given radius and
position in the world.
